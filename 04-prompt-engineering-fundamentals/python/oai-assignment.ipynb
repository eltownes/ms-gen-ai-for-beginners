    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "  - How does the concept of \"otherness\" play a role in the conflict?\n",
      "  - What lessons can we learn about cooperation and conflict resolution in the context of space exploration?\n",
      "\n",
      "**Creative Project (Homework or Extended Activity)**\n",
      "- Assign students to create a fictional diary entry, news article, or short story set during the Martian War of 2076. Encourage them to incorporate historical facts and themes discussed in class.\n",

      "### **Extensions:**\n",
      "- Invite a guest speaker (e.g., an astronomer or science fiction author) to discuss the future of Mars colonization.\n",
      "- Organize a debate on the ethical implications of colonizing other planets.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Resources:**\n",
